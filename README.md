# 1-Bit Simple ALU Project

## Project Description
This repository contains the implementation of a **1-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** designed using **Verilog HDL**. The project demonstrates the modular design of an ALU, integrating essential components like multiplexers and a 1-bit adder. Each component is thoroughly tested, and the full system functionality is verified through simulation.

This ALU performs basic arithmetic and logical operations controlled by input signals, such as inversion of operands, carry-in, and operation selection. A detailed truth table showcases the behavior of the ALU for different configurations.
